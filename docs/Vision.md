# Ora Protocol

### The data layer of web 3.0

# Overview
The Ora Protocol combines authenticated datastructures and peer-to-peer topology, to enable the next generation of decentralized infrastructure. It moves away from consensus and instead anchors data spaces to static verification systems, and structuring data in an Authenticated NoSQL database. In doing this, Ora Protocol is able to change the current paradaigm from server-client, to trustless network of data sets. This has several important features: 

- Consensusless Reads and Writes
- Authenticated and trustless data spaces
- Move towards zero latency
- Serving data to the edge
- Limitless scalability
- Greater security
